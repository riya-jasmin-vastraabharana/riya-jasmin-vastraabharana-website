How Videos Work — 3 Simple Rules
Rule 1 — Where to put your files
Put ALL images and videos in this ONE folder:
C:\Riya Jasmin Vastraabharana\riya-jasmin-vastraabharana\public\
You can paste 50 files at once — just Ctrl+A → Copy → Paste into that folder.

Rule 2 — How to add a product with video
Open src\App.tsx, find the PRODUCTS list and add like this:
tsx{
  id: "s005",
  sku: "RJV-SAR-KAN-002",
  name: "Blue Kanjivaram Silk",
  slug: "blue-kanjivaram",
  price: 8999,
  originalPrice: 13000,
  images: ["/kanjivaram-blue.jpg"],     // ← image in public\
  video: "/kanjivaram-blue-video.mp4",  // ← video in public\ (optional)
  tag: "Bestseller",
  desc: "Handwoven blue Kanjivaram silk saree",
  stock: 5,
  material: "Pure Mulberry Silk",
  occasion: ["Wedding", "Bridal"],
  category: "sarees",
  subcategory: "kanjivaram",
  whatsapp: "Hi! I want to order Blue Kanjivaram Rs 8999"
},

Rule 3 — Featured video section on homepage
Find FEATURED_VIDEOS near top of App.tsx and add:
tsxconst FEATURED_VIDEOS = [
  { src: "/collection-reel.mp4", title: "Festive Collection 2025", thumb: "/collection-thumb.jpg" },
  { src: "/bridal-video.mp4",    title: "Bridal Sarees",           thumb: "/bridal-thumb.jpg"    },
];
